roasts=GNOME: Removing features since 3.0 │ If a soyboy was a desktop environment │ Where customization goes to die │ If Lenin wore programming socks │ 'We know better than you' - The Desktop │ Where Linux development meets ideology │ System tray? Never heard of her │ Extensions break every update │ Minimizing windows is a power user feature │ GNOME devs: Making users migrate to KDE since 2011 │ Eulogizing legacy code as toxic masculinity since 2023 │ We fixed your workflow by removing options you didn't know you hated │ Your right-click was problematic; consider it canceled │ We liberated your desktop from X11's toxic flexibility │ Dynamic workspaces: Dynamic enough to disappear when you need them most │ Dynamic theming: Themes that adapt to your apps, by breaking them │ Open-source openness: Openly open to cancelling devs we dislike │ Why is all my text aligning left? │ False consciousness in flat design │ Dunning Kruger neckbeards conflating political praxis with programming, many such cases │ Bonus: Wayland mandate whether you asked or not │ Flatpak or bust, enjoy the sandbox │ UX decisions via committee cosplay
